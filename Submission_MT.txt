Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SELECT *
FROM [TABLE_NAME]
[attribute, business, category, checkin, elite_years, friend, hours, photo, review, tip, user]
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table

i. Business (id)= 10000
ii. Hours (business_id)= 1562
iii. Category (business_id)= 2643
iv. Attribute (business_id) = 1115
v. Review (id)= 10000
vi. Checkin (business_id)= 493
vii. Photo (id)= 10000
viii. Tip (business_id)= 3979
ix. User (id)= 10000
x. Friend (userid) = 11
xi. Elite_years (userid) = 2780


Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City: Las Vegas
Category: Shopping
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


+--------------------------------+-----------+-------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+----------------------+----------+
| name                           | city      | stars | review_count | address                     | postal_code | hours                | category |
+--------------------------------+-----------+-------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+----------------------+----------+
| Walgreens                      | Las Vegas |   2.5 |            6 | 3808 E Tropicana Ave        | 89121       | Saturday|8:00-22:00  | Shopping |
| Wooly Wonders                  | Las Vegas |   3.5 |           11 | 3421 E Tropicana Ave, Ste I | 89121       | Saturday|10:00-16:00 | Shopping |
| Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Las Vegas |   4.5 |           32 | 1000 Scenic Loop Dr         | 89161       | Saturday|8:00-16:30  | Shopping |
| Desert Medical Equipment       | Las Vegas |   5.0 |            4 | 3555 W Reno Ave, Ste F      | 89118       | Monday|8:00-17:00    | Shopping |
+--------------------------------+-----------+-------+--------------+-----------------------------+-------------+----------------------+----------+
We need more data to have a solid conclusion. 
But at the first glance, those with 4-5 stars open early with a longer duration (8-8-5 hours). 
The distribution of hours of 2.5 and 3.5 stars place vary. While 2.5 open early with longer duration (10 hours) while the 3.5 stars place opens later with shorter duration (6 hours).

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
These two groups have different number of reviews, but review_count does not correlate with the overal star rating. Particular, Desert Medical Equipment with 5 stars rating has the lowest review count while Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center with 4.5 stars rating has the highest review_count.        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

We might need further data to conclude, but place with 2.5 and 3.5 star rating usually locate in the same area (the same postal code). While the location of higher star rating places seem vary. 

SQL code used for analysis:
****code
SELECT
	business.name
	,business.city
	,business.stars
	,business.review_count
	,business.address
	,business.postal_code
	,hours.hours
	,category.category
	FROM (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id)
		inner join hours on business.id = hours.business_id
WHERE category.category = "Shopping" and business.city = "Las Vegas"
GROUP BY business.stars;

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The open one has higher number of reviews than the closed one.     
         
ii. Difference 2:
The open one has a higher average number of reviews than the closed one.         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT Count(DISTINCT(id))
	,avg(review_count)
	,sum(review_count)
	,avg(stars)
	,is_open
	FROM business 
	GROUP BY is_open

+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
| Count(DISTINCT(id)) | avg(review_count) | sum(review_count) |    avg(stars) | is_open |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+
|                1520 |     23.1980263158 |             35261 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|                8480 |     31.7570754717 |            269300 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------+

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS
Number_Of_Resturants,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),b.city
FROM (business b INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id)
INNER JOIN category c ON c.business_id = b.id
WHERE c.category IN
("Chinese","Mexican","French","Italian","Korean","Japanese","Ind
ian")
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Predict whether the overal star rating and number of reviews affect the number of people who check in. Finding of this problem could help managers have strategy to encourage more reviews or maintain quality of service.       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

We need attributes of business table: stars, review_count, checkin number to find the correlation among them.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-------+--------------+--------------------+
| stars | review_count | number_of_checking |
+-------+--------------+--------------------+
|   4.5 |           16 |                 64 |
|   4.0 |            5 |                 52 |
|   3.5 |            9 |                155 |
|   3.0 |           19 |                159 |
|   2.5 |            3 |                 24 |
|   2.0 |           16 |                 46 |
|   1.5 |            3 |                  1 |
|   1.0 |            4 |                  9 |
+-------+--------------+--------------------+         
 
In general, result shows that the number of review significantly affect the number of check of places especially to places with lower star rating (most clearly is to 2-2.5 stars). The higher star rating (ex, 4-4.5), the number of reviews is not significantly correlated with numbers of checkings.
While there are not many reviews for places with 3-3.5 star ratings, those place have the highest number of checking. 

This result indicates that there are other factors that can affect the number of checking besides star-rating level (maybe price or location). The number of review is correlated with number of checking when the star-rating is lower and are less likely correlated with number of checking when the star-rating is more than 3.0       
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT 
	business.stars
	, business.review_count
	,count(checkin.count) as number_of_checking
  	FROM business inner join checkin on business.id = checkin.business_id
    GROUP BY business.stars
    ORDER BY business.stars desc
